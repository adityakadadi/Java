Write a Java program using encapsulation and constructors to create a class to represent a complex number and perform the following operations:
a) Addition of two complex numbers
b) Subtraction of two complex numbers
c) Compare two complex numbers.

code:-

package project;

class ComplexNumber {

    private double real;
    private double imaginary;


    public ComplexNumber(double real, double imaginary) {
        this.real = real;
        this.imaginary = imaginary;
    }


    public double getReal() {
        return real;
    }

    public double getImaginary() {
        return imaginary;
    }

    
    public ComplexNumber add(ComplexNumber other) {
        return new ComplexNumber(this.real + other.real, this.imaginary + other.imaginary);
    }

 
    public ComplexNumber subtract(ComplexNumber other) {
        return new ComplexNumber(this.real - other.real, this.imaginary - other.imaginary);
    }

    
    public boolean equals(ComplexNumber other) {
        return this.real == other.real && this.imaginary == other.imaginary;
    }

    
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return real + " + " + imaginary + "i";
    }
}

public class ComplexNumberTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ComplexNumber c1 = new ComplexNumber(4, 5);
        ComplexNumber c2 = new ComplexNumber(3, 2);

        ComplexNumber sum = c1.add(c2);
        ComplexNumber diff = c1.subtract(c2);

        System.out.println("First complex number: " + c1);
        System.out.println("Second complex number: " + c2);

        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
        System.out.println("Difference: " + diff);

        if (c1.equals(c2))
            System.out.println("The two complex numbers are equal.");
        else
            System.out.println("The two complex numbers are not equal.");
    }
}
