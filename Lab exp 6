Write a Java program to define a base class bank, which holds
various details of customers such as name, account number, balance
and member functions to read, display and an abstract method to
calculate rate of interest earned by all the account holders. Derive
three classes namely City-Bank, SBI-bank, Canara-bank from this
base class, which are offering different rate of interests. Extend the
calculate method of base class with in these derived classes to
calculate and display the interest earned by all the account holders of
these banks

code:-

package project;

import java.util.Scanner;

abstract class Bank {
    String name;
    String accountNumber;
    double balance;

    void readDetails(Scanner sc) {
        System.out.print("Enter name: ");
        name = sc.next();
        System.out.print("Enter account number: ");
        accountNumber = sc.next();
        System.out.print("Enter balance: ");
        balance = sc.nextDouble();
    }

    void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Account Number: " + accountNumber);
        System.out.println("Balance: " + balance);
    }

    abstract void calculateInterest();
}

class CityBank extends Bank {
    void calculateInterest() {
        double interest = balance * 0.04;
        System.out.println("CityBank Interest: " + interest);
    }
}

class SBIBank extends Bank {
    void calculateInterest() {
        double interest = balance * 0.05;
        System.out.println("SBIBank Interest: " + interest);
    }
}

class CanaraBank extends Bank {
    void calculateInterest() {
        double interest = balance * 0.045;
        System.out.println("CanaraBank Interest: " + interest);
    }
}

public class BankDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        Bank[] banks = new Bank[3];
        banks[0] = new CityBank();
        banks[1] = new SBIBank();
        banks[2] = new CanaraBank();

        for (Bank bank : banks) {
            System.out.println("Enter details for " + bank.getClass().getSimpleName() + ":");
            bank.readDetails(sc);
            bank.displayDetails();
            bank.calculateInterest();
            System.out.println();
        }
        sc.close();
    }
}
